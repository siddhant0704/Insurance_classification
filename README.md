# ML-project-4
Insurance prediction

Develop ML model to correctly identify properties that have a high chance of being successful. The motivation of the project is to help real estate make money but accurately suggesting properties that
they should invest in. 

The preprocessing steps included - Dealing with missing values, Converting object data type to int, Imputing data, Box cox transformation.

Performed scaling using Robust scaler, Encoding using One Hot and target, Upsampling using SMOTE.

Built and evaluated 3 different models - Logistic regression, Random forest and XGBoost classifier.

Using Feature importance and SHAP values for model interpretibility.

Two types of metrics used are Online - Accuracy, Precision,Recall, F1-score and Offline - Cash flow, Return on Investment (or ROI)
